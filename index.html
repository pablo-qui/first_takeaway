           This page explains the main features of the shiny app in the repository.
           <br>
           There are five tabs in the app.
           <li>
               The first one is just a brief description of the dataset.
           </li> 
           <li>
            The second tab shows the data, allowing the user to visualize and filter the data according 
            to the two categorical variables.
        </li> 
        <li>
            The third one allows to represent one of the continuous variables against other and compare 
            the points according to the two categorical variables. It also shows the different means for each variable
            depending on the categorical variable chosen.
        </li> 
        <li>
            The fourth one shows a knn regression model that tries to predict the species of the crab based 
            on the other variables. The user can change the number of neighbours to consider and the train/test size 
            and generate a report with the results.
        </li> 
        <li>
            The last one includes the references used for building the app.
        </li>
